Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
Founded in 2017, AtliQ emerged as an IT & Business Consulting company dedicated to facilitating the seamless integration of business processes through automated tools.
Their strategic insights and dependable processes have yielded exceptional outcomes across diverse industries, fostering contented clients, fruitful partnerships, and rapid expansion

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.
