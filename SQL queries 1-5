** 1. Provide the list of markets in which customer "Atliq Exclusive" operates its business in the APAC region.

SELECT customer, market, region
FROM dim_customer  
WHERE customer = 'Atliq Exclusive' AND region = 'APAC'
GROUP BY market 
ORDER BY market;

** 2. What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020? The final output contains these fields, unique_products_2020, unique_products_2021, percentage_chg

WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT 
fiscal_year,
COUNT(DISTINCT Product_code) as unique_products 
FROM fact_gross_price
group by fiscal_year
)
SELECT 
p1.unique_products as unique_products_2020,
p2.unique_products as unique_products_2021,
Round((p2.unique_products - p1.unique_products) *100 / (p1.unique_products),2)  AS percentage_chg
FROM product_counts p1
cross join product_counts p2
WHERE p1.fiscal_year = 2020 AND p2.fiscal_year = 2021;


** 3. Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and sort them in descending order of product counts. The final output contains 2 fields, segment and  product_count

SELECT 
segment, 
COUNT(DISTINCT product_code) AS product_count
FROM dim_product
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY product_count DESC;


** 4. Follow-up: Which segment had the most increase in unique products in 2021 vs 2020? The final output contains these fields, segment, product_count_2020, product_count_2021,difference

WITH segment_product_counts AS (
SELECT 
dp.segment,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN fs.fiscal_year = 2020 THEN fs.product_code END) AS product_count_2020,
COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN fs.fiscal_year = 2021 THEN fs.product_code END) AS product_count_2021
FROM dim_product dp
JOIN fact_sales_monthly fs ON dp.product_code = fs.product_code
GROUP BY dp.segment
)
SELECT 
segment,
product_count_2020,
product_count_2021,
product_count_2020 - product_count_2021 AS difference
FROM segment_product_counts;


** 5. Get the products that have the highest and lowest manufacturing costs. The final output should contain these fields, product_code, product, manufacturing_cost

SELECT 
dp.product_code,
dp.product,
fm.manufacturing_cost
FROM dim_product AS dp
JOIN fact_manufacturing_cost fm ON dp.product_code = fm.product_code
WHERE 
    fm.manufacturing_cost = (SELECT MAX(manufacturing_cost) FROM fact_manufacturing_cost) 
    OR 
    fm.manufacturing_cost = (SELECT MIN(manufacturing_cost) FROM fact_manufacturing_cost)
ORDER BY fm.manufacturing_cost DESC;
